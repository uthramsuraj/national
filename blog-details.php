                    <p>In 2022 we will continue to see a revolution in the construction industry. Many factors, such as
                        advancements in technology, rising material costs, eco-friendly and sustainable initiatives,
                        supply
                        chain delays,. and labor shortages are forcing many rapid changes in the industry. The
                        popularity of
                        utilizing equipment rental is also gaining momentum.</p>

                    <p>National Dispatching offers a one call solution for renting equipment.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Why is the popularity of equipment rental increasing?</h3>

                    <p>For many reasons, construction equipment rental is becoming more popular. Modern equipment has
                        revolutionized the way projects are performed and managed. While people are looking at the
                        budget
                        and other aspects of the business in search of cost reductions, they can also compare the cost
                        of
                        renting or leasing equipment with purchase and ownership costs.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges for builders is to reduce budget without compromising quality. The
                        best solution is to find effective labor, equipment, and material resources.</p>

                    <p>In recent years we have seen a major disruption in the financial stability of many private
                        companies, companies whose investments drive the construction industry. Those companies have
                        been
                        looking for ways to reduce their operating costs and as a result are reducing their construction
                        budgets. At the same time, the cost of production, materials, equipment, and labor are creating
                        a
                        ripple effect in the industry.</p>

                    <div class="detail-inner-image-wrap">

                    </div>

                    <h3 class="title">Why can renting heavy equipment be better than buying it?</h3>

                    <h4>Helps reduce overall costs</h4>
                    <p>In the construction industry, a general rule is that if you have a short term need, you should
                        consider renting it. The purchase of new construction equipment is expensive, if you can find it
                        these days, and can have a significant impact on an organization’s budget. The rental option has
                        become popular for many construction companies as it allows them to cut long term costs and run
                        a
                        more financially sound business. The quality of the work cannot be compromised at any cost. But
                        managing costs and productivity is important.</p>

                    <p>In addition, the purchase of equipment is a long-term investment. Initially, the company’s
                        financial
                        situation may allow a purchase. But, as the economy changes, so do organizations’ financial
                        situations. By renting equipment it will help you align your current financial situation with
                        long-term expectations.</p>

                    <h4>Improves efficiency</h4>
                    <p>Construction companies are usually juggling multiple projects at once. Different projects may
                        require different equipment. In those cases, instead of incurring the logistical costs of moving
                        equipment from project to project, consider renting specific equipment for a specific project’s
                        locations. This eliminates any delays you may experience and helps to provide each project with
                        the
                        proper resources to efficiently complete the project.</p>

                    <h4>It helps to avoid maintenance issues</h4>
                    <p>Buying and maintaining equipment is not an easy task. The space for storage, regular maintenance
                        intervals, inspections, etc. should be considered while purchasing equipment along with the
                        expenses
                        that come along with it. With renting equipment, the time and labor costs associated with
                        maintenance and repair are much lower and easier to manage. Instead of worrying about
                        maintaining
                        the equipment for its life lifecycle, rentals allow you to focus on the near future instead of
                        spending time planning for long-term maintenance.</p>

                    <h4>Access to the latest technology</h4>
                    <p>Once you buy equipment that fits the budget range and requirements of that period, it is not easy
                        to
                        upgrade to more advanced equipment at a later time. Technology changes and there is always more
                        advanced machinery being released to the market. Renting offers you the option to choose from a
                        wider selection of late model equipment that will allow you to always be using the latest
                        technology.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">How to choose the right rental partner</h3>

                    <p>We understand that selecting the best equipment supplier for your project is a critical decision
                        for
                        any project team. From customer service, to product availability, and price, there is a lot to
                        consider when choosing the right supplier.</p>

                    <p>At National Dispatching, we focus on building long-lasting relationships with our customers. We
                        know

                    <p>Another factor we are very proud of is our vast supplier network. Every project has different
                        equipment needs and that’s why having access to the right equipment when you need it is an
                        essential
                        part of the equipment supplier relationship. The benefit of renting heavy equipment from

                        find the exact equipment you need, when you need it.</p>

                    <h4>Price</h4>
                    <p>With the current supply chain issues, many rental partners are having a hard time replacing their
                        aging fleet. At the same time, rental fleet utilization for many categories are at all time
                        highs.
